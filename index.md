### What's this blog all about ?

Any experienced developer will know there are times where there isn't anything to lean on - stuck-in-the-mud due to a lack of personal knowledge and no learnings to be found on the web - sometimes you really are on the bleeding edge and compilers break unexpectedly etc. It's worth documenting those times (alongside more frivolous posts). 

2024 - it's an interesting time in technology - never has it been so easy for someone from a non-development background to write a couple of dozen lines of ill-considered Python and still get tremendous results.. and never has there been such a demand for "full-stack" which makes no sense at all, a car mechanic may well be great at tuning an engine but would you let them tune a cruise liner turbine ? A Titan 3 rocket ? Of course not.. so it is such an absurb ask!

Anyway, some pages of interest below.
