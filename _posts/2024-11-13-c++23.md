*** Some motivation

I learned C++ at University around 1994/1995 even though it wasn't on my curricula - I undertook a degree in Electronic Engineering at the University of Southampton so the taught language was C and I recall in '96 the Computer Science gang learned Java 1.0 in the Autumn semester. I was happy with C++. I learned the Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) implementation of the C++ Standard Template Library and then later in the 90s when in industry onto specific implementations such as RogueWave or the native compiler implementations under gcc, on various platforms such as HP-UX, DEC Alpha, Linux etc.

Although I did take an interest in the TR-1 standard, and to an extent Boost I effectively lost interest by the time the C++11 standard came around. Fast-forward a number of years, I've decided to re-up my knowledge to the C++23 standard.

*** The Good, The Bad, The Ugly and Dante's Nine Circles of Hell

Good: Lambdas, Ranges, Coroutines and Modules
Bad: Visual Studio has overtaken gcc!
Ugly: Some of the C++20 standard isn't implemented yet in 2024 and some of the 2023 standard is broken
Inferno: Many, many bugs on gcc affecting even the basics such as module compilation and a lack of co-ordination to facilitate Makefiles properly
